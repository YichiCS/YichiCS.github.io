Hi 👋! I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Information Engineering at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ) and Prof. [Qianqian Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a2WEREUAAAAJ). Starting in September 2025, I will join [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) as a Ph.D. student in Informatics under the supervision of Prof. [Yuchen Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bugfOowAAAAJ). My current research interests primarily lie in trustworthy machine learning and machine learning theory.

<br>
✨✨✨ I am always looking for collaborators who are full of energy and ideas. If you are interested in 🛡️ trustworthy machine learnin, ⚡ efficient machine learning or 📚 machine learning theory, feel free to reach out to me anytime.

This website is still under construction. I am learning how to use HTML and CCS to build a website instead of using a template...
